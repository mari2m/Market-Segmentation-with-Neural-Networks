Project Title: Neural Network for Binary Classification

Project Overview
This project aims to build a neural network model for binary classification using a dataset that includes various features such as age, job type, marital status, and other relevant attributes. The model is designed to predict the target variable based on the input features, utilizing techniques such as grid search for hyperparameter tuning and visualization of results.

Features
Implementation of a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.
Grid search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Visualization of training history and model results.
Detection and handling of outliers in the dataset.

Tools
Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow
Keras
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn


Data
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file 

Model Architecture
The neural network model consists of:

Input layer
Multiple hidden layers with varying units and activation functions
Output layer for binary classification
The architecture can be modified in the create_model function in the main.py file.

Results
The project includes visualization of model performance, including accuracy and loss over epochs. After hyperparameter tuning, the best accuracy achieved was 0.9135.
